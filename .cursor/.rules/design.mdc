Design Learnings from This Project
1. Progressive Disclosure Pattern
* Optional fields are now hidden by default and only revealed when needed or when they contain content
* This creates a cleaner, more focused UI that emphasizes required fields first
* Users can expand sections as needed, reducing cognitive load
1. Consistency in Form Design
* Single-column layout provides better readability and a clearer visual hierarchy
* Each form field has a consistent structure with clear labeling and appropriate spacing
* Optional fields are consistently marked and handled the same way throughout the application
1. Visual Affordances
* Chevron icons clearly indicate expandable sections
* Icon selection helps users understand the purpose of each field (Info for description, FileText for instructions, MessageSquare for resources)
* Border styling on collapsible sections provides clear visual boundaries
1. Contextual Visibility
* Fields automatically expand when they contain data, improving usability during editing
* This balances between keeping the UI clean and ensuring users don't miss existing data
* The reactive approach (using useEffect) ensures the UI stays in sync with the data model
1. Improved Resource Management
* Simplified the resources approach from file uploads to text input
* Text-based approach is more versatile for storing conversation contexts and reference materials
* "Reference text available" indicator provides clear feedback without cluttering the interface
