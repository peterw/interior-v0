# Remotion App Feature Specifications (Optimized for Facebook Ads ROAS and Fast Video Creation)

## Overview
This spec details features for a Remotion-based app to generate 10 ready-to-go Facebook video ads quickly. Remotion enables programmatic video rendering with React for dynamic animations, transitions, and text. Videos are short (15-30s default) and optimized for Facebook (vertical 9:16 or square 1:1, <100MB MP4, H.264, silent-friendly with text/captions).

Focus on ROAS optimization: Incorporate best practices like fast hooks (first 3s attention-grabbers), UGC support, A/B variations for testing (e.g., hooks/CTAs), value-driven structures (problem-solution-CTA), captions for 85% silent views, high-engagement elements (vertical format, concise text <20% screen).

Focus on speed: Minimize manual work via presets, reusability, one-click batch rendering (<5min for 10 videos), auto-optimization (e.g., compression, proxy rendering).

Assumptions: Server-side rendering; e-commerce focus; compliant with Facebook specs.

## Core Features

### 1. User Input Interface
- React UI with minimal forms for fast input:
  - Product details: Name, description (auto-split into hooks/benefits), CTA (e.g., "Buy Now").
  - Media: Upload 3-5 UGC/images/videos (auto-crop to vertical/square).
  - Brand: Colors, fonts, logo (auto-apply high-contrast for readability).
  - Duration: 15-30s slider (default 15s for engagement).
  - Variations: Auto-generate 10 for A/B (e.g., vary hooks, CTAs, colors).
- ROAS opts: Checkbox for "ROAS Mode" – enforces hooks, captions, retargeting tags.
- Speed: One-page wizard; auto-suggest text from description (e.g., AI placeholder).
- Preview: Real-time Remotion player with play/pause.
- Validation: Auto-check text ratio (<20%), mobile optimization.

### 2. Video Composition Structure
- Remotion composition with modular scenes: Hook (0-3s), Body (product showcase), CTA (last 5s).
- FPS: 30; Ratios: 9:16 vertical (default for Stories/Reels, higher engagement).
- Layers (stacked for parallax):
  - Background: Brand-gradient or UGC overlay.
  - Media: Auto-apply Ken Burns zoom for statics.
  - Text: Mandatory captions (auto-sync to scenes).
  - Audio: Optional stock tracks (short loops for non-silent).
- ROAS: Structure enforces high-conversion flow (attention → interest → desire → action).
- Speed: Templates load in <1s; auto-trim media to fit duration.
- Tagging: Tag scenes/assets (e.g., "hook-ugc") for reuse.

### 3. Transitions and Animations
- Transitions: Fade/slide/zoom (0.3-0.5s for fast pacing).
- Animations:
  - Hook: Burst-in text/media for 3s grab (e.g., question/problem).
  - Text: Slide-up bullets, typewriter CTAs.
  - Media: Quick pans/zooms for dynamism.
  - CTA: Pulse button with arrow.
- Presets: "High-ROAS" (fast, energetic for conversions) vs. "Smooth".
- ROAS: Auto-add engagement boosters like motion in first frame.
- Speed: Save custom animations as JSON presets; apply via dropdown.
- Save: "Save Preset" button stores params (e.g., easing, duration) in user library.

### 4. Text on Screen
- Dynamic: Auto-generate from input (headlines, bullets, subtitles).
- Styling: Large (>24pt equiv.), bold, high-contrast; Google Fonts.
- Placement: Bottom/center for mobile; <5 lines total.
- ROAS: Enforce captions (85% views silent); short copy (e.g., benefits as bullets).
- Speed: Auto-timing (e.g., text appears sequentially).
- Tagging: Tag styles (e.g., "cta-red") for quick reuse.

### 5. Variation Generation
- Auto-create 10 vars for A/B testing (key for ROAS):
  - Vars 1-4: Hook variations (e.g., question vs. stat).
  - Vars 5-7: CTA tests (text/placement/color).
  - Vars 8-10: Media/transition tweaks (e.g., UGC vs. stock).
- Logic: Rule-based randomization with ROAS bias (e.g., prioritize vertical, short hooks).
- Output: ZIP of MP4s + metadata (e.g., "Var1_HookQuestion.mp4").
- ROAS: Include pixel placeholders for tracking conversions.
- Speed: Parallel rendering; optimize with proxies.

### 6. Reusability Features
- Save Animations: Customize (e.g., tweak easing), save as preset; library search by name/tag.
- Tagging: Add tags to assets/elements (media, text, scenes); search/filter for import.
- Library: User account storage; drag-drop to compositions.
- Speed: Reduces setup time by 50% for repeat campaigns.
- ROAS: Reuse high-performers (e.g., tag "winning-cta").

### 7. Rendering and Export
- One-click batch: <5min total via GPU/cloud.
- Optimization: Auto-compress, add thumbnails.
- ROAS: Export with ad-ready specs; optional watermark.
- Speed: Progress bar; fallbacks for errors.

### 8. Integrations
- APIs: Pexels/Unsplash for stock UGC-likes.
- Ext: Edit code for pros; future AI for auto-hooks.
- ROAS: Facebook API placeholders for upload/tracking.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Performance: Fast renders; secure uploads.
- Scalability: Queue for users.
- Future: AI auto-optimize.
